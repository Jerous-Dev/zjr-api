# Code of Conduct – zjr-api

## Our Pledge

I, Jerous (Jr), as the transformer and maintainer of the zjr-api project, pledge to uphold the following principles for the benefit of the community:

- Actively maintain and improve the library: simplifying the source code, reducing bugs, and optimizing performance.
- Foster a friendly, open, and harassment-free community for everyone—regardless of age, gender, race, skin color, location, religion, experience level, or any other characteristic.
- Promote a respectful and inclusive environment where contributors feel welcome and safe.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Showing empathy and kindness toward others
- Being respectful of different opinions, backgrounds, and experiences
- Offering constructive feedback and accepting it gracefully
- Taking responsibility for mistakes, apologizing when necessary, and learning from them
- Prioritizing the well-being of the community over personal agendas

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment of any kind
- Sharing others' private information without their explicit permission
- Any behavior that would not be acceptable in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct. They will take appropriate and fair action in response to any behavior that violates these standards.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject any contributions (e.g. comments, code, issues, wiki edits) that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They may also ban temporarily or permanently any contributor who behaves inappropriately, threatens others, or harms the community.

## Scope
